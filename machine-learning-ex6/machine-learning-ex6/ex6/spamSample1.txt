Hello Shivankur Kapoor,


	      Merry Christmas & A Very Happy New Year!


	      Christmas is time to be with your near and dear ones and express your gratitude for having them in your life. We, at CodeChef, would like to thank you, for giving us yet another memorable year. Yes, it had its fair share of ups and downs, but together, we walked through them and created some memories to cherish in the coming times. Now, as the year 2015 slowly walks into the realm of past years, let us come together for the one final contest of the year 2015, the December LunchTime 2015.


	      The chilly Sunday morning on 27th December 2015 will bring in the warmth of the problems from Sergey Kulik and we are sure you would enjoy them. So, mark the last Sunday of 2015 as LunchTime Sunday, and join us for the celebrations.
